Undoubtedly, good food is the most essential when it concerns life and healthy-living. To live our lives, we require the nutrients contained in the foods we eat. The food we eat can either save us, weaken us or kill us.

There are two major ways we can obtain quality non-GMO foods; either we pay high prices and buy them from organic food stores or we plant them by ourselves.
The later is not only cheaper but guarantees highest quality of food.

To be able to have the culture of agriculture inculcated into our kids, we must teach our kids how to plant, nurture, harvest and store good.

This is the reason why ArtKids foundation has launched various kids-farming initiatives to transfer our knowledge of agriculture to our next generation who will also transfer theirs to their next generation. Endlessly so.

Apart from producing the food we consume, another advantage of farming is our interactions with mother nature via the soil, leaves and roots as we cultivate the land and plant seeds.

It's unbelievable that the world left agriculture for white-collar jobs. Its time to retrace our steps.

Lets go!!!!
