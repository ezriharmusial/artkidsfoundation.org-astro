In our various communities, we are bordered seeing our jobless youths parading our streets and committing one crime or another. The truth is that most of these younger ones are not skilled on any professional jobs; thus, are unemployable.
One area we have often failed to look at when it comes to having these kids engaged in money-making ventures is the discovery of their various musical talents.

DiscoverME is the ArtKids talent-hunt-program through which the musical talents of our youths~be that; song writing, composition, singing or dancing is showcased before the public, discovered and sponsored by ArtKids&Partners to the benefit of the talented youth in particular and our communities in general.

Yearly, ArtKids Foundation organizes DiscoverME Talent-hunt to identify, showcase, sponsor and promote upcoming artists from one community (neighborhood) to another.
