Our 21st century is aggressively unfriendly towards technology illiterates. So much so that such people have little or no hope to survive the digital systems of the 21st century. 

Mostly affected are our elders during whose times, analogue systems were in vogue. To ensure that our children are not only computer literates but also technologically aware, ArtKids foundation has launched ICT interventions designed to interactively and most-friendly train our kids and have them digitized.
