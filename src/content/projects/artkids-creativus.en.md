'Us' and 'We' are magical words when it comes to Mutually Beneficial Ventures (MBVs). 'Us' and 'We' gave birth to 'Company'. 

As no one tree can make a forests, "it takes two to tango". 
Unfortunately, the lack of win-win collaborations is the reason why most Africans are weak and poor. Compare them to Europeans, Americans, Russians and Asians; you will see that collaboration is the top-most secret of industrial successes. 
In these parts of the world, "people work with people".
Through ArtKids CreativUs program, mutually beneficial collaborations are encouraged. 

By pulling resources together (Intellect, Concepts, finances, manpower, materials, organization, raw materials, ideas, HR etc.) mutually beneficial (win-win) long-lasting relationship between the collaborating parties is cemented. 

This is the purpose of ArtKids CreativUs program under ACBi.
