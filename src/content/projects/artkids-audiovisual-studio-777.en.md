Once a creative musical or theatrical talent is identified through DiscoverME TalentHunt, ArtKids signs the upcoming artists and comfortably produces the artists in our State of the Art  Studio (ArtKids AudioVisual Studio 777). 

This way, ArtKids Foundation leaves no stone unturned in ensuring that our discovered upcoming artists are never stranded or hopeless.

Beside professional music production, ArtKids Audiovisual Studio 777 produces video clips for our upcoming artists. 

This way, ArtKids upcoming artists would not have to worry for the funding of both their music and their video clips productions.
