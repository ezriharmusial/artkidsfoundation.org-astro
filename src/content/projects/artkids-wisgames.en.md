Let's use interactive and edutainment games to develop and wisen-up the brains of our kids by intentionally exposing them to online, offline and network games that are designed to interactively transfer useful information and knowledge that charge Kids brains.

It's our duty as teachers and parents or guardians to sharpen-up and wisen up our kids. 

Instead of allowing our kids to childishly choose corruptible games, it would be more secured for our families and our society if we spend some quality times with our kids playing games that are specially designed to wisen them up.
