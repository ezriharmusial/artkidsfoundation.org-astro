Disclaimer: Igbo is Africa~Africa is Igbo. By definition, Igbo people are the so-called Blacks, Africans, Black Americans, Haitians, Jamaicans, Yorubas, Hausas etc. The Black Race is Igbo Race.

Welcome to IGBO\_SUN ENERGY SUMMIT 2018 @Umueke Villa in Nkwerre of Imo~Igboland of West Africa in advance.

As if plagued, epileptic Electricity or the lack of Electric Energy is major among the greatest challenges Igbo and Africans face on daily bases. The setback caused by inadequate power supply has affected Igbo/African lives, daily living, businesses, Industries and physical illumination of Igbo/Igboland in particular and Africa in General.

It is not only illogical but also unbelievable that the Igbo who seat under the blazing influence of Hottest\_Sun lack Sun Energy to power and empower their lives.

As the children of the Sun, Igbo and African people should have had constant and endless Sun energy from the beginning of time. Regrettably that is not and has never been the case.

Our mission for calling for IGBO\_SUN ENERGY SUMMIT 2018 is to join hands together to provide Igbo and Africans with high quality Solar Systems to power their lives, gadgets, homes, businesses and industries.

While ArtKids International supports the use of third party Solar Energy Systems for the startup, our ultimate goal is to collaborate with International Solar Energy Research Institutes in inventing high quality but affordable Solar Energy for African Consumption affordable because most Africans especially those in rural areas are not rich.

ArtKids International hereby invite Solar Energy Experts, Researchers, Manufacturers and African Solar Energy Consumers to the 1st IGBO\_SUN ENERGY STAKEHOLDERS SUMMIT 2018 to be held on the **10th of November 2018** @UmuEke Villa Hall UmuEke in Nkwerre, Imo, Igboland~West Africa.

We look forward to warm, fruitful, result-oriented and memorable Sunny Dialogue. Welcome to Igboland.
