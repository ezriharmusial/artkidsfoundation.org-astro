content: "<p>Undoubtedly, good food is the most essential when it concerns life and healthy-living. To live our lives, we require the nutrients contained in the foods we eat. The food we eat can either save us, weaken us or kill us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are two major ways we can obtain quality non-GMO foods; either we pay high prices and buy them from organic food stores or we plant them by ourselves.\r\nThe later is not only cheaper but guarantees highest quality of food.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo be able to have the culture of agriculture inculcated into our kids, we must teach our kids how to plant, nurture, harvest and store good.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the reason why ArtKids foundation has launched various kids-farming initiatives to transfer our knowledge of agriculture to our next generation who will also transfer theirs to their next generation. Endlessly so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nApart from producing the food we consume, another advantage of farming is our interactions with mother nature via the soil, leaves and roots as we cultivate the land and plant seeds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt's unbelievable that the world left agriculture for white-collar jobs. Its time to retrace our steps.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLets go!!!!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n            <figure class=\"image is-2by1 box effect-selena has-text-left has-text-white has-text-weight-semibold has-text-shadow\">\r\n                <div class=\"dcll-bgwrap\" style=\"background-color:#484327;\"></div><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAEhDJwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"https://www.artkidsfoundation.org/app/uploads/2023/04/agric-2-135x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"135\" height=\"180\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-medium wp-image-7254 dcll-image dcll-placeholder\" />\r\n\r\n                <figcaption>\r\n                    <p class=\"title has-text-white is-size-5-desktop is-size-6-touch\"></p>\r\n                    <p class=\"subtitle has-text-white is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-touch\"></p>\r\n                    <p class=\"content\"></p>\r\n                </figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n\r\n"
