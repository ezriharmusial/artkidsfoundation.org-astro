Yes! It is now possible for Individuals and/or Companies to represent ArtKids Foundation and ArtKids International in your own country. By so doing, you would become a partner in progress with ArtKids.

Much is not required except the knowledge of administration, accountability and trustworthiness. Also important is the time to run ArtKids in your country.

Are you interested and do you have the time?
