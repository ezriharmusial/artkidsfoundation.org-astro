Technically speaking, our kids are gifted with various degrees of incentive and/or innovative processes.

To harness these inventive talents and practically empower these kids, two things are needed;

1.  R&D TrustFund
2.  Research Collaboration Centre:
    To copiously research and develop a given concept or idea, fund is required. Since these kids lack the needed fund for Research&Development, ArtKids~ICT has created a TrustFund called 'ArtKids Inventors TrustFund' through which ArtKids Inventors are adequately funded.\\\\
