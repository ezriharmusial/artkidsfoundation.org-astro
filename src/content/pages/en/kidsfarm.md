ArtKids Foundation secures farmland preferably near the partner-school.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe pupils (from 4yrs old) are practically taught the basic principles of farming (cultivation, planting, irrigation, manure, Sunlight, harvesting, storing and cooking).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBecause we teach them young, kids will find it easy to practically learn the basic principles of farming and will hold on to the acquired knowledge all their lives.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNature2Nature is a module of  KidsFarm through which we teach our kids to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals such as Fertilizer and Insecticides.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKids are made to innerstand the dangers of using dangerous chemicals in planting of the food we eat, because; \"whatever one sows, same shall he or she reap\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo support KidsFarm:\r\nDonate\r\nGrant\r\nSponsor\r\n<p>\r\n            <figure class=\"image is-2by1 box effect-selena has-text-left has-text-white has-text-weight-semibold has-text-shadow\">\r\n                <div class=\"dcll-bgwrap\" style=\"background-color:#434c30;\"></div><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAENMMAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"https://www.artkidsfoundation.org/app/uploads/2023/04/kidsfarm-2-240x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-medium wp-image-7319 dcll-image dcll-placeholder\" />\r\n\r\n                <figcaption>\r\n                    <p class=\"title has-text-white is-size-5-desktop is-size-6-touch\"></p>\r\n                    <p class=\"subtitle has-text-white is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-touch\"></p>\r\n                    <p class=\"content\"></p>\r\n                </figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n\r\n"
