In cooperation with school pupils, parents and teachers, ArtKids Foundation has launched KidsFarm in rural areas from country to country. ArtKids Foundation secures farmland preferably near the partner-school.

The pupils (from 4yrs old) are practically taught the basic principles of farming (cultivation, planting, irrigation, manure, Sunlight, harvesting, storing and cooking).

Because we teach them young, kids will find it easy to practically learn the basic principles of farming and will hold on to the acquired knowledge all their lives.

Nature2Nature is a module of KidsFarm through which we teach our kids to avoid the use of dangerous chemicals such as Fertilizer and Insecticides.

Kids are made to innerstand the dangers of using dangerous chemicals in planting of the food we eat, because; "whatever one sows, same shall he or she reap".
