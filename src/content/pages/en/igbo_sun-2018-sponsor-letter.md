It is therefore a great surprise that \"the children of the Sun have been in the dark~let us change this ugly narrative as a team.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Granted, Igboland has enough Sun Energy to power All homes, businesses and Industries in Igboland~hence, IGBO-SUN ENERY 2018-Forever.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Interesting stakeholders and Potential sponsors have been selected to join forces with ArtKids Foundation in lightening Africa by lightening Igboland through IGBO-SUN ENERGY PROJECT.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Among invited reputable potential stakeholders/Consumers are; Igbo/African Technical Brains (Thinkers, Inventors and Innovators), Asian Solar Energy Research Institutes, Asian Solar Energy Manufacturers, Philantropists, Business Investors and Energy Consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>We hereby appeal for your sole sponsorship or co-sponsorship of IGBO-SUN ENERY Summit of November 10th 2018. See enclosed Event Budget for your appreciated consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Stakeholders' win-win/profit-sharing methodology:<br>\r\n          As a stakeholder, you are a co-owner of the profits made by IGBO-SUN ENERGY PROJECT carried out by ArtKids International for Igboland through ArtKids Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p>Sponsorship Benefits:<br>\r\n          By sponsoring or co-sponsoring IGBO-SUN ENERGY SUMMIT 2018, you will share in the publicity IGBO-SUN is sure to generate.
