Dear Sir/Madam,

Greetings from ArtKids Foundation Holland-a Not-for-Profit and Non-Governmental Organization that is practically putting back smiles on the faces of Millions of Africans via the introduction of our life-changing IGBO_SUN ENERGY (IKE'ANWU).

For ages, Africa was spiritually and physically left in thick darkness. While Africa's spiritual darkness was unseen, her physical darkness which is caused by Epileptic Electricity or the total lack of Electricity is as evident as day light~awaiting your arrival.

All Government efforts through Hydro Electric Power Generation as well as individual and Community Efforts through Power Generators could not address the Electric Energy challenges presently faced by African home, businesses and industries not to talk of solving them.

This is the reason for ArtKids' introduction of Sun Energy in Igboland and Africa. Igboland is called "The land of the Rising Sun" because of being located in the heart of the Sun where energy resides. It is therefore a great surprise that "the children of the Sun have been in the dark~let us change this ugly narrative as a team.

Granted, Igboland has enough Sun Energy to power All homes, businesses and Industries in Igboland~hence, IGBO-SUN ENERY 2018-Forever.

Interesting stakeholders and Potential sponsors have been selected to join forces with ArtKids Foundation in lightening Africa by lightening Igboland through IGBO-SUN ENERGY PROJECT.
