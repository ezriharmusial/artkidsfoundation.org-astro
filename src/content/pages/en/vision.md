## Mission Statement <small class="has-text-calm is-size-4">Goal & Direction</small>

The visible inequality which has unfortunately triggered unnecessary hardship as a result of world poverty among Africans in particular and the so-called third world in general is a reason for the establishment of ArtKids Foundation and ArtKids International in 2013\. Since their establishment, both organizations have helped many Africans through Technologies, ICT, Knowledge Transfer, Internet Empowerment; as well as Business development supports. May we use this opportunity to thank our various donors and direct/indirect supporters, most of all our Spiritual Pillar-Ya'huwah~Ala (Chi'Ukwu).

## Objectives <small class="has-text-calm is-size-4">Rebuilding & Restoration</small>

ArtKids Foundation has developed a working concept, by which from the formulated basic principles the following objectives are actively pursued:
To acknowledge and stimulate creativity and spontaneity of children and youth, and work to develop talents. To help Youth with extraordinary talents who at the same time posses great self motivation, to transform their talent into their profession. By means of creative expression of children and youth, stimulate the involvement and relationship with their parent(s) and their social environment therewith empower their position in society. Utilize the creativity of children and youth to establish a balanced, undisturbed social and emotional development of children and youth. To bring about a mutual inspiring interaction of children and youth and their parent(s) and social environment, professional expressive artists, businesses, civil society organizations and society in the broadest sense of the word. The objective is to us creativity as a mean to build inter connectivity.

## Basic Vision <small class="has-text-calm is-size-4">Child & Creativity</small>

1.  ## Importance of creative expression of the Child

    1.  #### Creativity & Intelligence

        The use of Creative (art)forms to express emotions, in combination with thinking about it, is a continuous practice of on the one hand to become more aware of emotions and on the other hand to use expressive art as a mean to apply solution oriented thinking. Consequently this cultivates the development of creativity, intelligence and the ability to have and express empathy.

    2.  #### Personality-/Identity development

        Every internal experience or emotional and rational processing is every time completely unique and personal. With that one such expression is an observable conformation of ones self. The child hence grows confidence in coming out for ones personality/identity and with using it to dare to manifest ones self. Furthermore the child is able to both express and develop personality/identity over time, because it of a growing self understanding.

    3.  #### Critical Observance

        The process of the realization of an expressive (art) representation of something is a challenge of meticulous observance, and therefore works to the advantage of the development of the ability of critical observance.

2.  ## Child and parrent/family

    1.  #### Parent-child relationship

        From the subjects previously mentioned in point A). about de direct importance of creative (art) expressions of the child the conclusion can be derived, that personal involvement of parent(s) in this process can be of utmost importance. After all: on the one hand parents can hereby exert a stimulating influence and on the other hand ‘affirmative’ actions towards the child. This can be of great importance for the advancement of warm (positive) parent-child relationships. Such an relationship is necessary for a child to develop ’emotional attachment’ and a sense of ‘basic safety and security’.

    2.  #### Parental sentiment

        Genuine interest of parents for the creative expressions of their child and the importance of these expressions, contributes to the appreciation and esteem of the parents towards their child. In addition this on itself contributes to a good parent-child relationship. The same applies to contingent family members.

3.  ## Child and Society

    1.  #### Social behavior and empathy

        Al the subjects previously mentioned in points A en B will work, provided that good accompaniment, advances the development of social behaviors and the ability to to have and express empathy towards the child.

    2.  #### Emotional balance

        Al the subjects previously mentioned will contribute to an emotionally balanced child.

    3.  #### Emotional restoration

        Development of social behavior, of the ability to have and express empathy, of emotional balance and of critical observance, form the counterbalance against for example manifestation of ‘symptoms of estrangement’, destructive fears, superficiality, extreme prejudice, escapism and feelings of emptiness, uprootedness and inferiority.

4.  ## Natural, conscious and spiritual

    Every choice influences personal development and self conditioning. ArtKids Foundation commits itself to upholding human innocence by informing parents about all positive and negative influences of which a child is confronted. We hereby apply de basic spiritual laws of the Creator of all that exists as manual.

    1.  #### Protecting the Child against negative influences

        Because of the so called 'western standard' that has been imposed on the world through politics, religion, education, advertisement and entertainment, a child is exposed from birth to violence, aggression, ego, sex, materialism, total loss of respect, discrimination, bullying, vandalism, unhealthy living, laziness, boredom etc.. In many if not all movies and TV-series, and in the world of advertisement children and youth are targeted to be sublimely influenced in their behaviors through exemplary negative characters and images. This negativity is promoted as the "New Norm" of which in the end, only the industry profits. By learning to understand and identify these negative influences, parents can help to protect their own children.

    2.  #### Appropriate use of technology

        Children and adults are more often in different dimensions because of digital platforms. Children and Youth who use computers without accompaniment have the tendency to focus on games and social media, looking for mindless or shocking subjects on the Internet. Even though these same computers provide the ability to create music, edit movies, create digital images, write stories, the ability to search and discover life changing information and more. The trick is to let the child experience that modern technology has many more interesting things to offer than just games and pastime, also children must realize that there is life besides the on/off switch.

    3.  #### A natural way of life

        The world is becoming more and more fake and crazy. Realizing that children are our future, it is of utmost importance to learn the child that not everything that happens around us today, was considered as normal or appropriate behavior in the past. Many allergies and behavioral disorders are relatively easy solved by adopting a natural eating pattern and increase physical exercise. Through informing and educating parents and children, awareness is created on what we eat and drink, what we consider as 'normal', and what consequences these ingredients have on body, mind and spirit. What influence the eating of unclean meat has on our physical and mental health, why natural food is better than chemically treated and genetically manipulated food, why fruit and nuts can and should replace candy, cookies other unhealthy snacks to change lives, what impact it has to replace soft drinks with natural and fresh fruit juices homemade lemonade, tea and water. And why it pays of to grow your own vegetables, even when we think there is no garden or space to do it. A natural way of living brings happiness, health, energy, positivity and so much more.

## Method of working <small class="has-text-calm is-size-4">Facilitating & Funding</small>
