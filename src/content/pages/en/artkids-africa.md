When we think of 'Underdevelopment', Africa quickly comes to mind. For years, ArtKids foundation has, through collaborations, assisted many in Africa without being resident in Africa. With the permanent relocation of one of ArtKids' directors Engr. Ezekwesiri Obioha (ICT) to his place of birth in Igboland of West Africa, ArtKids Foundation became resident in Africa with an office and contact address.

Since 2015 ArtKids Foundation/International are adequately represented in Africa.

For your enquiries, Sponsorship and/or collaboration, please feel free to contact ArtKids Africa.
