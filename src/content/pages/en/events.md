Artkids Foundation has spent a good number of years Preparing to be able to Realize the Above Comprehensive Activities Calendar in Igbo-land Africa.

We have spent almost 9 years diligently working with the locals behind the Scenes to Realize the Necessary Foundations for our Self-Sustaining and Regenerative projects in Igboland of Africa.

Besides our State-of-the-art ICT department that Carries all our Digital Communications, we have Realized and Gathered the Traditional Counsel of Elders to Approve, Initiate and oversee our Projects Abroad, according to original Igbo Culture and Customs.

It's 2023 and ArtKids Foundation is Proud to be practically carrying our meaningful projects that target Women and the youths as benefactors under our Re-Newed ANBI status by the Dutch Tax Office!

Rejoice!
