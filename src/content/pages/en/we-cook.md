content: "<p>\r\n\"All works and no food makes kids weak\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne who learns to cultivate, plant, irrigate, nurture and harvest the food should do marvelously well in also knowing how to cook the food he or she produced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe-Cook is an ArtKids program through which kids are taught how to cook the food they produced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this program, kids are taken to the market to buy some of the ingredients they did not produce (as no one produces all ingredients). This way, kids are exposed to purchases and costs of ingredients in our markets. Childishly, kids participate in pricing and purchases (fun).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOnce the enlisted ingredients are complete, guided by an adult, kids prepare a delicious food using some of the ingredients they produced in KidsFarm. Thereafter, the meal is served and eaten together as one family.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat's KidsFarm\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n            <figure class=\"image is-2by1 box effect-selena has-text-left has-text-white has-text-weight-semibold has-text-shadow\">\r\n                <div class=\"dcll-bgwrap\" style=\"background-color:#4e4540;\"></div><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAE5FQAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=\" data-src=\"https://www.artkidsfoundation.org/app/uploads/2023/04/we-cook-3-270x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"180\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-medium wp-image-7330 dcll-image dcll-placeholder\" />\r\n\r\n                <figcaption>\r\n                    <p class=\"title has-text-white is-size-5-desktop is-size-6-touch\"></p>\r\n                    <p class=\"subtitle has-text-white is-size-6-desktop is-size-7-touch\"></p>\r\n                    <p class=\"content\"></p>\r\n                </figcaption>\r\n            </figure>\r\n\r\n"
