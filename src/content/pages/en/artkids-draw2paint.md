Once a child learns to hold the pencil, parents would do well to pay a close attention to what their child does with the pencil in his or her hand without guiding them. The child now carelessly draws without minding if the drawing is beautiful or not. Once this careless childlike drawing gets to ArtKids professional painters, the childish drawing is enlarged and traced, then creatively colored to clearly bring out the thoughts of the child to light. Because the painting still retains the exact shape as was drawn by the kid, the final product is recognizable by the kid who drew the original drawing.

This how ArtKids Draw2Paint works with kids as partners in progress.
